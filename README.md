# AI Customer Service
## Project Overview
The AI Customer Service project is designed to streamline the customer onboarding process and enhance customer interactions by leveraging Python and the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API. This project aims to collect, categorize, and store customer voice data, including requests, complaints, queries, and feedback, in a MongoDB database. By automating these tasks, the project aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of customer service operations.

## Features
* Voice Data Processing: Python is used to extract and process voice data from customers during the onboarding process.

* Categorization: The OpenAI GPT-3.5 API is utilized to categorize customer voice data into four main categories: requests, complaints, queries, and feedback.

* Data Storage: MongoDB is employed as the database to store the categorized voice data for future reference and analysis.

## Getting Started
To get started with the AI Customer Service project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/Analyst-Ninja/AI-Customer-Service.git
```
2. Install the necessary dependencies. You may use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set up your MongoDB instance and configure the database connection in the project's settings.
4. Obtain an API key for the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API and set it as an environment variable or in the project configuration.
5. Run the project using the provided Python scripts or application entry point.

## Usage
* **Customer Onboarding**: During the customer onboarding process, collect voice data from customers using the provided methods.
* **Voice Data Processing**: Utilize Python to process the voice data, preparing it for categorization.
* **Categorization**: Utilize the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API to categorize the voice data into one of the following categories: request, complaint, query, or feedback.
